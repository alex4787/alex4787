### Hi, I'm Alex!

- 💼 I'm a [Shopify Dev Degree](https://devdegree.ca/) intern, currently on the developer skills training path
- 🎓 I'm a computer science student at Carleton University (Class of 2024)
#### 🔧 What I'm working on
- An 🛍️ eCommerce website using Rails<br>
  ✅ Base website built using MVC in Rails<br>
  ✅ Data linked up with SQL database<br>
  ✅ Built fully-functional GraphQL API<br>
  ✅ Built a React front-end using [Shopify Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/) components
  - [ ] Currently adding additional features and testing the React front-end
#### 🌱 What I'm learning
- Dev Degree:
  - I'm currently learning React!
  - In May, I'll be joining the API Patterns team, a back-end GraphQL-focused team, as a developer
  - Since September, I've learned Ruby, SQL, Git, Ruby on Rails, and the Scrum development framework
- Node.js and web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, ExpressJS, Pug, MongoDB, Mongoose)
- C and basics to systems programming
#### 🧰 Some Past Projects
- **critique**: a 🎥 movie database website for my Web Development course<br>
  - A website built on ExpressJS with a Mongoose/MongoDB database and Pug template rendering
  - Similar to IMDB, it allows users to browse various movies, actors, directors, writers, and other users
  - Users may also create an account to follow industry people and other users, add movies to the database, and manage their watchlist
  - It also recommends movies to users as well as presents a selection of similar movies for each movie in the database
- **[def not_bad_trivia](https://github.com/ParanoidAndroid-C/topeka/tree/java)** for [cuHacking 2021](https://2021.cuhacking.com/)
  - A trivia game for audiences at music events built in Android Studio with questions generated using the Spotify API and connected/hosted through Firebase (though it didn't entirely work out the way we expected - see the Readme)
  - 🥈 Won 2nd place for the [Ross Video](https://www.rossvideo.com/) Fan Engage-o-meter challenge!
  - I learned more about using APIs, namely the Spotify API through the SpotiPy wrapper, as well as more about Node.js

- **[No Laughing Matter](http://nolaughingmatter.online/)** for [Hack the North 2020++](https://hackthenorth.com/)
  - A party game that connects users over video using Socket.io and WebRTC and analyses their laughter after a joke using the face-api library built on top of TensorFlow.js
  - ☝️ My first hackathon! I worked on the design in Figma and the front-end, and learned some basic Node.js and how to deploy using Heroku!
