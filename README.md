### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
- ðŸ”Ž I'm currently working in the domain of relevance engineering to enhance search relevance in the [Shop app](https://shop.app/) â€” working primarily with Elasticsearch
- ðŸŒ‡ In the past, I've worked on developer tooling for GraphQL API development, metric validation tooling for an online experimentation platform, and building a data catalog on Google Cloud Platform
- ðŸš€ I've also worked on a few projects, including a [neural network-based clothing classifier](https://github.com/alex4787/fashionify-nn), an [agent-based model](https://github.com/Enilk13/MAS) simulating crowd behaviour in evacuation settings, and an [online game](https://github.com/alex4787/htn2021) where jokes told are scored based on a laughter-detecting face-tracking algorithm

Feel free to reach out to me via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-chan4787) or [email](mailto:alex.chan4787@gmail.com)!
